    "## Semi-Honest Base OT Syntax and Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-Honest Alice ($\\mathbb{A}$) has two single-bit messages $m_0$ and $m_1$. Semi-Honest Bob ($\\mathbb{B}$) has a single bit choice bit $b$. Alice wants to send one -- and only one -- of her two messages to Bob. Bob, depending upon his choice bit $b$, wants to access $m_b$ but does not want Alice to know which message he picked. This interaction is summarized in the following diagram:\n",

    "<img id=\"basic-ot\" src=\"./Diagrams/BasicOT.svg\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",

    "The correctness requirements for an OT protocol are obvious: If Bob's choice bit is $b$, then $\\forall m_0, m_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$, with high probability Bob should receive $m_b$. \n",

    "**Notation**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> * For a function $f$, inputs from different parties are separated by a semicolon '$;$'. In particular, oblivious transfer as a function is represented by following notation $$\\textsf{OT}(m_0,m_1;\\; b) \\to m_b$$ where input $b$ is separated from $m_0$ and $m_1$ by a semi-colon to represent that it came from a different party. This notation can be extended to $k$ parties. \n",
    "> * Alice's view (transcript) while interacting with Bob is denoted as $$\\langle\\mathbb{A}, \\mathbb{B}\\rangle(m_0, m_1, r_{\\mathbb{A}};\\; b)$$ where $r_{\\mathbb{A}}$ is Alice's private randomness during protocol execution.\n",
    "> * Similarly Bob's view while interacting with Alice is denoted as $$\\langle\\mathbb{B}, \\mathbb{A}\\rangle(m_0, m_1;\\; b, r_{\\mathbb{B}})$$ where $r_{\\mathbb{B}}$ is Bob's private randomness during protocol execution.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Alice's Privacy**: Let Bob's choice bit be $b$ and let $\\mathcal{D}$ be a polynomial time distinguisher that a corrupt Bob is trying to use to glean extra information about $m_{1-b}$ from its message transcript $$\\tau := \\langle \\mathbb{B}, \\mathbb{A}\\rangle(m_0, m_1;\\; b, r_\\mathbb{B})$$ An OT scheme preserves Alice's privacy if, given $\\tau$, the probability that $\\mathcal{D}$ can distinguish $m_{1-b}$ from $1$ (or $0$) with probability significantly greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$ is negligible, i.e.,  $$\\forall \\mathcal{D} \\in \\text{p.p.t} \\wedge \\forall \\tau:\\;\\mathbf{Pr}\\left[\\mathcal{D}(b, m_b, \\tau) = 1\\right] < \\frac{1}{2} + \\textsf{negl}$$ where the probability is taken over the random choices made by $\\mathcal{D}$.\n",
    "2. **Bob's Privacy**: Let $\\mathcal{D}'$ be a polynomial time distinguisher that a corrupt Alice is trying to use to find information about $b$ from its message transcript $$\\tau' := \\langle \\mathbb{A}, \\mathbb{B}\\rangle(m_1, m_2, r_\\mathbb{A};\\; b)$$ An OT scheme preserves Bob's privacy if, given $\\tau'$, the probability that $\\mathcal{D}'$ can guess the value of $b$ with probability significantly greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$ is negligible, i.e.,  $$\\forall \\mathcal{D}' \\in \\text{p.p.t}\\wedge \\forall \\tau':\\;\\mathbf{Pr}\\left[\\mathcal{D}'(m_1, m_0, \\tau') = b\\right] < \\frac{1}{2} + \\textsf{negl}$$ where the probability is taken over the random choices made by $\\mathcal{D}'$.\n",

    "secure oblivious transfer protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Proof** [$\\textsf{OT} \\implies 2\\textsf{pc}_\\wedge$]: Suppose $\\mathcal{P}_0$ has bit $b_0$ and $\\mathcal{P}_1$ have bit $b_1$ and $\\mathcal{P}_0$ and $\\mathcal{P}_0$ want to use $\\textsf{OT}(m_0, m_1;\\; b)$ to _securely_ compute $b_0 \\wedge b_1$. Here's how the two parties can proceed:\n",
    "> 1. $\\mathcal{P}_0$ acts as the $\\textsf{OT}$ sender and $\\mathcal{P}_1$ acts as the $\\textsf{OT}$ receiver.\n",
    "> 2. As an OT sender, $\\mathcal{P}_0$ feeds $m_0 \\leftarrow 0$ and $m_1 \\leftarrow b_0$ to the oblivious transfer black box.\n",
    "> 3. As an OT receiver, $\\mathcal{P}_1$ feeds $b \\leftarrow b_1$ into the OT black box.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Claim: The output of above OT setup securely computes $b_0\\wedge b_1$. Correctness holds because $\\textsf{OT}(0, b_0;\\; b_1) = \\left [0\\wedge (\\neg b_1) \\right ] \\oplus \\left [b_0\\wedge b_1 \\right ] = b_0\\wedge b_1$. Since OT preserves sender and receiver's privacy, the privacy of user's inputs $b_0$ and $b_1$ are also preserved. Furthermore, depending on whether OT is maliciously secure or semi-honestly secure, secure function evaluation (SFE) of $\\wedge$-gate achieves the same security goals.\n",
